				The policy of women's empowerment is incorporated well
				into the constitution of India which became effective in the
				year 1950. Article 14 ensures the right to equality for
				women; Article 15(1) prohibits gender discrimination; Article
				15(3) empowers the state to take affirmative steps in favour
				of women, to name a few.
				Women's empowerment can be defined to promoting women's sense of self-worth, their
				ability to determine their own choices, and their right to influence social change for
				themseleves and others.
				Women's empowerment has become a significant topic of discussion in development and economics.
				 Economic empowerment allows women to control and benefit from resources, assets, and income. 
				 It can result in approaches to support trivialized genders in a particular political or social

			There are many reasons behind this illiteracy rate among women The most important reason is the lack of 
			proper resources. In India, most of the women are illiterate because they are not allowed to go for 
			education. Society thinks that men must educate their children, especially girls, because they think that 
			women's role is only to take care of the house and family. If she starts going to school or university, then
			who will look after her house? Moreover, sometimes when women send their children to schools, they are
			not allowed to sit in the same class as their male counterparts. 
			
			This is because of the social customs and traditions which are still prevailing in our society. The Government 
			of India has made it mandatory for all the schools to provide education to girls till middle school. However,
			this is not being implemented properly because of the lack of resources. The lack of resources is not the
			only reason behind the illiteracy rate of women. The mindset of people is also one of the main reasons. In
			our society, the role of women is still considered to be limited to the house and taking care of the family. This
			mindset is changing slowly, but it will take some time to change completely.

	We are all entitled to human rights. These include the right to live free from violence and discrimination; to enjoy the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health; to be educated; to own property; to vote; and to earn an equal wage.
	But across the globe many women and girls still face discrimination on the basis of sex and gender. Gender inequality underpins many problems which disproportionately affect women and girls, such as domestic and sexual violence, lower pay, lack of access to education, and inadequate healthcare.
	For many years women’s rights movements have fought hard to address this inequality, campaigning to change laws or taking to the streets to demand their rights are respected. And new movements have flourished in the digital age, such as the #MeToo campaign which highlights the prevalence of gender-based violence and sexual harassment.
